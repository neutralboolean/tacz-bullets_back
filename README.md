A highly-configurable mod that uses TACZ Unidict to add bullet drops to mob kills, when using guns. For Forge 1.20.1.

When you shoot a thing, it'll drop bullets for the gun you're using, with a chance to drop rounds for other guns too. The config file is pretty verbose and should explain what each setting does.

Honestly, unlikely to maintain this beyond personal interests, so abide by the license,e but feel free to fork and continue.
